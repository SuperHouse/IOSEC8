Security Sensor Shield for Arduino
==================================
Copyright 2017 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd  
SuperHouse site:  www.superhouse.tv  

Based on the circuit described in the "Security / Automation Sensors"
project in the book "Practical Arduino", this breakout allows up to 8
security sensors to be connected with full End-Of-Line (EOL) support to
detect tampering.

Supported sensors include:

 * PIR (passive infrared) motion detectors.
 * Microwave motion detectors.
 * Reed switches.
 * Glass break detectors.
 * Gas detectors.

End-Of-Line technology allows the system to detect a variety of events
using a single cable pair to the sensor, including:

 * Sensor triggered.
 * Sensor cable cut.
 * Sensor cable short-circuited.
 * Sensor housing opened (even when system is disarmed)

Compatible with I/O breakouts such as the I/O Breakout and I/O Breakout
Mega, both from SuperHouse.

Features:

 * Supports 8 sensor channels simultaneously.
 * Sensor power supply connections.
 * Green "Sensor power on" LED.
